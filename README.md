# EchoKey

**EchoKey** is a quantum-inspired cryptographic framework that combines fractal regression, acoustic modulation, and dynamic synergy metrics to achieve secure, adaptive, and resilient encryption. This system introduces innovative methods for real-time cryptographic modulation, designed to explore the intersection of quantum mechanics, sound, and security.

## Features

- **Fractal Regression**: Utilizes recursive patterns for adaptive key generation.
- **Acoustic Modulation**: Integrates sound-based refraction mapping for cryptographic stability.
- **Dynamic Synergy Metrics**: Continuously adapts to input data and environmental changes for enhanced security.
- **Quantum Resistance**: Built to withstand future quantum-based cryptographic attacks.
