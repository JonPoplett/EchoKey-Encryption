# EchoKey

**EchoKey** is a quantum-inspired cryptographic framework that integrates fractal regression, acoustic modulation, dynamic synergy metrics, and advanced key management techniques to achieve secure, adaptive, and resilient encryption. This system introduces innovative methods for real-time cryptographic modulation, designed to emulate the stability and unpredictability of quantum systems through classical computing paradigms.

## Features

- **Fractal Regression**: Utilizes recursive, self-similar patterns for adaptive key generation, ensuring high entropy and unpredictability.
- **Acoustic Modulation**: Integrates sound-based refraction mapping to enhance cryptographic stability and randomness, simulating environmental quantum influences.
- **Dynamic Synergy Metrics**: Continuously adapts to input data and environmental changes, balancing randomness and order for enhanced security.
- **Deterministic Secret Key Generation**: Derives a consistent secret key from the seed using SHA-256, ensuring symmetric encryption and decryption processes.
- **HMAC-SHA256 Keystream Scrambler**: Employs HMAC-SHA256 to generate secure and unpredictable keystreams, enhancing the robustness of the encryption process.
- **Non-Linear Parameter Updates**: Implements non-linear mathematical functions to dynamically adjust encryption parameters (`alpha`, `beta`, `omega`), preventing predictable patterns and increasing randomness.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Incorporates feedback from previously encrypted/decrypted bytes into the system's state, reducing byte-level correlations and improving overall security.
- **Enhanced Byte Scrambling**: Combines robust XOR operations with byte rotation to achieve superior data scrambling, ensuring high entropy in ciphertext.
- **Optimized Performance**: High-speed encryption and decryption powered by Numba-accelerated processes, allowing efficient handling of large data sets.
- **Quantum Resistance**: Designed to withstand future quantum-based cryptographic attacks, ensuring long-term security viability.
